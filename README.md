# predicting-olympic-medals

##Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop models for predicting the number of medals won by each country at the Rio Olympics in 2016 using information that was available prior to the Games.

##Questions of interest 
The main questions of interest are: 
• Which variables are associated with the number of medals (total/gold or both) won in the 2012 Olympics? 
• How well does a model based on data up to and including 2012 predict Olympic performance in the 2016 Games? 
• What improvements might be made to the model/data collected in order to better predict Olympic medal counts for future Games?
